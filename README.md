Data-driven projects in marketing analytics, NLP, audience research, and public engagement.

## One-Sentence Summary
I apply data analytics and natural language processing to measure and optimize how branding, media content, digital platforms, and public-interest campaigns influence consumer behavior, audience perception, and engagement.

## One-Paragraph Summary
My analytical projects apply data science, NLP, and marketing analytics to understand how communication strategies and digital interventions shape real-world behavior. This includes predicting stock market movements using New York Times headlines through NLP models, analyzing how platform-specific ratings affect video game sales, designing digital voter outreach interventions for the New York City mayoral election, evaluating audience perceptions of AI-generated versus human-created art using A/B testing and ANCOVA, and conducting social media analytics for Love, Bonito. I also apply these methods in large-scale nonprofit fundraising and community engagement projects at PEER and Education Without Barriers. Across these projects, I integrate statistical modeling, experimental design, and marketing analytics to study behavior in commercial, civic, and public-interest contexts.
